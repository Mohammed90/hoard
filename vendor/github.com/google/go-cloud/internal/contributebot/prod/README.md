# Contribute Bot Production Configuration

Primary documentation is in the [main README][].

This is the production configuration for Contribute Bot. It is set up as a
separate [Terraform module][] to keep the configuration in version control while
allowing developers to create their own modules for test deployments.

As noted in the main README, you can use this directory as a template for your
own dev setup.
